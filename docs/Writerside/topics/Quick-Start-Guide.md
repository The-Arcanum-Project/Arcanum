# Quick Start Guide

Arcanum is a powerful tool with many advanced features. This guide will get you started with the basics, though
additional features will be detailed in their respective sections later.

> Arcanum is still work in progress (WIP). Some issues may cause corruption of your mod files. Always use a backup or
> version control system, such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## First Startup

After [installing](Install.md) Arcanum, launch the tool for the first time.
During this initial startup, Arcanum will create essential files and folders to store settings and configurations.
You will then be taken directly to the [](Main-Menu.md).

> If you encounter any issues during the first startup, please reach out to [us](https://discord.gg/9878NDb6uf).

## Main Menu

In the [](Main-Menu.md) you can create a new project on the top.
Which leads you to the [Configure Tab](Main-Menu.md#arcanum).

<include from="Main-Menu.md" element-id="create-new-project"/>

## Loading Screen

When a project begins to load, the **Loading Screen** will appear.
This screen displays:

* Progress indicators showing the current loading state
* Quirky loading tips to keep things light while you wait

If you selected an existing mod, you may also encounter the [](ErrorSystem.md).
This system will alert you to any issues detected within your mod files.

> For more details about the **Error System**, see the dedicated [documentation page](ErrorSystem.md). There you will also
> learn how to adjust error severity levels to match your preferences.

## Main Editor


Once loading is complete, you will enter the **Main Editor**, the primary workspace for creating and modifying your mods.
