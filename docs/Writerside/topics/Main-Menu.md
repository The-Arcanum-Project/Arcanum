# Main Menu

The **Main Menu** is the default landing page when you launch Arcanum.
It includes multiple tabs as listed below and provides the functionality to open or create a project.

## Quick Access Bar

The **Quick Access Bar** at the top provides quick access to your projects:

* **New Project:** Opens the [Arcanum Tab](#arcanum) to create a new mod configuration.
* **Last Project:** Launches your most recently used project.

> The last project button will switch its behavior depending on the tab you are currently in.
> In the Arcanum Tab it will launch the current configuration as entered instead of the last one.
