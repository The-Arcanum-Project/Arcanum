# The Arcanum Project

This project aims to build and improve upon what its predecessor [Minnator's Modforge](https://github.com/Minnator/Minnators-Modforge) has achieved.
The main difference is that this tool is meant for the game **Europa Universalis V** also known as Project Ceasar.
It is being developed by [MelonCoaster](https://github.com/mel-co) and [Minnator](https://github.com/Minnator).
We develop this in our spare freetime so the speed of progress may vary from time to time.

## What are we aiming for?
Minnator's Modforge already has a nice suite of tools and decent performance, but we want to shadow this:
- Shader based map rendering
- Project files to ease editing and resume where ever you left of
- Full plugin support to have users add or expand features how they like it
- Smart history tree to be able to undo and redo any action taken
- Quick and consistent loading times
- All ingame mapmodes
- Interactive map for selection and editing
- PDX map editor for all games which share the same format of province definition in a `.bmp` file.
- Mission / focus "autocompletion" and implementation aid
- Detailed error detection and pinpointing to file and line
- Hot reloading support for mod and game files
- Selfdocumenting codebase and features
